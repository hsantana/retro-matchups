retro-matchups
==============

This project fills a MySQL database with Batter vs Pitcher stats and player's stats at a Park from Retro Sheet files.


Databse:

I started with Lahman database.
I deleted columns I didn't need.
I deleted tables I didn't need.
I deleted old data I didn't need.
More information to come.

I added new tables:
TimeHitters: hitters stats during day or during night.
TimePitchers: pitchers stats during day or during night.
ParkHitters: Hitters stats in a specific stadium. Stadiums are taken from parks  table.
ParkPitchers: Pitchers stats in a specific stadium. Stadiums are taken from parks table.
Matchups: Hitters vs Pitchers stats.

More detailed information to be added.
